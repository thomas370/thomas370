# 👋 Hi there! I'm Thomas Bortolato  

> _"Code, sleep, repeat. Unless there's coffee, then just code."_ ☕

## About Me  
I'm a **Junior Web Developer** passionate about learning, building, and breaking (then fixing) things.  
🔧 My favorite tools include **React**, **Symfony**, and **SQL**, but I also love experimenting with Python and creating fun projects like my [Arborescence Python](https://github.com/thomas370/Arborecense_python).  

When I'm not coding, you can find me:  
- 🚵‍♂️ Riding my mountain bike on rocky trails (trying not to crash).  
- 🎮 Playing **Valorant** as a Smoker or diving into other fun games like **Rocket League** or **Fall Guys**.  
- 🤔 Trying to figure out why my last commit broke everything.  

## What I Do  
🌟 I specialize in building clean, efficient, and scalable web apps.  
💡 Currently, I'm focused on creating tools and platforms that simplify life (or at least make coding less boring!).  
📚 Always learning: I'm exploring **Java** and improving my Python projects.  

## My Projects  
- 🚀 [Arborescence Python](https://github.com/thomas370/Arborecense_python): A tool to bootstrap Python project folders (work in progress).  
- 🎲 [Challenge-Gaming](https://github.com/...): A platform to track gaming challenges across various games (coming soon!).  

## Fun Facts  
- I once spent 3 hours debugging, only to realize I forgot a semicolon.  
- My favorite Pokémon is [insert your favorite Pokémon]!  
- I'm on a mission to collect all the **Crown Zenith Pokémon cards**.
